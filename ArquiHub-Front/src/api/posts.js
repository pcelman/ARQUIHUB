      "The house faces the Mediterranean, in a place where an imposing dune protects the coastline from storms. This starting point defines the configuration of the project. The house materializes with two volumes arranged perpendicular to each other.</br>In order to have views of the sea, the program of uses of the house is inverted with respect to the traditional scheme, the day floor is arranged on the upper floor to be able to look over the level of the dune and takes advantage of the lower level roof as a gazebo. </br>The sleeping area is located on the access level, perpendicular to the sea. The circulation is arranged in the most public part of the plot open to the pool area, while the rooms open onto a beautiful consolidated garden with small species that existed in the place. The flight of the upper floor ends with a kind of cloister open from above that allows the main room to be illuminated from the south while maintaining privacy, and at the same time casts the necessary shade on the lower level. The staircase is drawn at the intersection of both volumes marking the access point of the house.</br> In short, two volumes adapted to enjoy the surrounding conditions, the views, the shade... nothing more, nothing less.",

A three-dimensional structure of screens and reinforced concrete slabs is chosen that adapts to the topography, carrying out the minimum possible earthworks.</br>This monolithic structure anchored to the rock generates a horizontal platform, at the access level from the street, on which the house is located. The pool area is located at a lower level in an existing flat area on the plot. The concrete structure is thermally insulated on the outside, with a smooth, flexible, white lime stucco as a finish. The rest of the materials, walls, pavements, roof gravel...maintain the same color emphasizing the unitary character.",

      "A landscape surrounded by consolidated gardens, an elevated and elongated plot with a distant view of the sea, and a pleasant breeze, constitute the sought-after and fortunate starting point for this story.</br>Three elements make up the project by the Valencia Fran Silvestre Architects studio. An extruded roof in the longitudinal direction of the land in the shape of a T constitutes the structure under which the inhabited space is located. This geometry allows you to feel the sea while protecting yourself from the gaze of others, seeking the sensation of living without neighbors. Helps control the southern sun during the summer and lets it through in the winter. The walkable roof is transformed into a kind of belvedere that enjoys the entire surface of the plot.</br>A single free-standing piece of furniture houses the structure of the Hofmann House and distributes the spaces filtering privacy, opening possibilities in the way of circulating and using the space. The main room, under the cantilevered shadow, is arranged in continuity with the outside. The interior of the furniture includes the wet parts and delimits the scale of the night areas that fall to the quieter portion of the garden. The studio opens on the corner with the best views.</br>These two elements, cover and furniture, are deposited on the stone base in which the sheet of water and the rest of the uses of the house are excavated, giving rise to the third element. These spaces adapt to the natural unevenness that exists on the plot.</br>A project by Fran Silvestre Arquitecto Valencia.",

      "Thought to disappear. This is how the concept for this house on the island of Mallorca, a few meters from the shore of the Mediterranean, is presented.</br>The house is made up of a set of pieces that move in one of the directions, offering exterior spaces as patios between the various volumes that house the different interior uses. Thus, with this movement, a volume is fragmented into small parts, giving each of them a unique character and its own autonomy.</br>The house is conceived with materials of natural origin, but built with current technology, paying attention to economy, precision and continuity. The floor layout maximizes the relationship with the outside and prioritizes views of the sea through large openings protected from solar incidence by eaves that generate large outdoor terraces.</br>Various starting points justify the formal and technical strategies that have been adopted for its design. First of all, special attention is given to landscape integration.</br>Secondly, its adaptability capacity is valued, both to the environment where it is located and to the surrounding vegetation. The fundamental aspects in terms of its sustainability are also considered through technical solutions based on an innovative tradition that allows the generation of comfort spaces. Finally, special emphasis is placed on the user experience, offering spaces to enjoy the landscape and outdoor space with the necessary privacy.",

      "We have always been fascinated by the work of Andreu Alfaro -The door of the Universe- made in 1983. A circle rotated and suspended on a square. For some years it was located at the door of our studio, and its ability to make us reflect was surprising, to locate ourselves at the base at the end of the day and think that we were indeed before a threshold that opened the door to an infinite space.</br>An analogous effect is felt when visiting the “In Praise of the Horizon IV” made by Eduardo Chillida in 1989 in Gijón. Where, according to the author himself, the viewer is put in direct relation with the work and with the Universe. Chillida himself wondered Isn't the present, like the horizon, another frontier, another limit, another dimensionless place always full of questions?</br>>This idea of ​​open centrality, as a representation of something unfathomable, has always fascinated humanity and architecture has echoed this fascination countless times.</br>With these references continually floating around in our minds, a place located in the city of Marbella appeared, on a plot with a large slope and at an elevated level that provides fantastic views. The place would seem ideal to place an astronomical observatory, but the proposed program is that of a house. We propose to embrace with a circumference a space open to the sky and the horizon, and simultaneously protected from the gaze of others and the powerful winds of the area.</br>The rooms on the upper level open in a controlled manner towards specific landmarks in the landscape, while the public area enjoys the relationship with the main and open space. Perhaps in this way we can live on a daily basis in this space that has always captivated us, a place in which what is evident in nature is difficult or impossible to achieve is revealed.",
