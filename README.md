# ARQUIHUB
Both architects and programmers work as a group in large projects. We found that there was no way to share files between architects and comment on changes in a centralized manner.
ARQUIHUB solves this problem allowing users to upload their files, choose their collaborators and have each collaborator upload different updates.
Even working individually, it is important to have a place to record the changes and be able to go back if necessary and study the different alternatives proposed.
